## üìå Project Overview

This project is a contactless smart home automation system that enables the user to control **light intensity** and **fan speed** using specific hand gestures. Designed using **MediaPipe** and **OpenCV** for gesture detection and an **Arduino Uno** to generate PWM signals, it offers an intuitive and hygienic method of controlling devices.

PWM signals are transmitted based on the number of fingers detected. The system uses a **MOSFET** to control the DC fan and adjusts LED brightness using PWM. A **flyback diode** (1N4007) is used to protect the fan circuitry from voltage spikes caused by inductive load switching.

## üß† Gesture-to-Action Mapping

| ‚úã Finger Gesture | üî¶ LED Brightness       | üå¨ Fan Speed         |
|------------------|-------------------------|----------------------|
| ‚òùÔ∏è 1 Finger       | Dim                     | Off                  |
| ‚úåÔ∏è 2 Fingers      | Off                     | Low Speed            |
| ü§ü 3 Fingers      | Full Brightness         | Off                  |
| ‚úåÔ∏è‚úåÔ∏è 4 Fingers    | Off                     | High Speed           |
| ‚úã 5 Fingers       | Full Brightness         | Full Speed           |

Gestures are processed via MediaPipe‚Äôs 21-point hand landmark detection, and the detected finger count is mapped to PWM signals sent to the Arduino Uno to drive connected appliances.
